The first *release candidate* is now available :). That means that the API documentation is also now
available on [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gotschmarcel/goserv). Check it out and feel free
to contact me (hello@goserv.it) if you have ideas for improvement.

Enjoy the rest of your weekend :)
